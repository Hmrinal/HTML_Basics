# HTML_Basics

## Is HTML a programming language?
This is quite a refuted topic. So the answer is both yes and no, depending on the context. Generally, a programming language allows you to describe some sort of process of doing something, whereas HTML is a way of adding context and structure to text.

### Programming Language:
- They mainly have functional purposes
- Has common conditional statements such as If/Else
- Can evaluate expressions or do any math
- It handels events or carry out tasks
- Variables can be declared and functions can be written
- It can modify or manipulate data in  multiple ways
- Can take input and produce output 

### Html can do:
- Type of markup language
- It encapsulates, or "marks up" data within HTML tags, which define the data and describe its purpose on the webpage.
- The Web Browser reads the HTML, that gives details about the parts like headings, paras, links, etc
- Describes the data on web browser, and browser then displays the data accordingly.
